# COVID-19 phenotypes

## Study population inclusion criteria

All *first* hospital admissions occurring amongst *first* infections in our cohort as defined where the admission date is in the study era ()and there is one of:  

- a) `U071`, `U072` codes occurring in any position in their diagnosis (acute COVID-19 codes)  

- b) `U073`, `U074` codes occurring in a primary position only (the other two SARS-CoV-2 infection related codes)  

- c) a PIMS-TS code (`R65`, `M303`, `U075`) alongside none of the exclude codes (see PIMS-TS row) after the date PIMS-TS was defined (May 2020)   

- d) A positive test for COVID-19 14 days before hospitalisation up to the date of discharge.   

This description defines the study population with a SARS-CoV-2 related admission.

## COVID-19 admission types
In this work we classify COVID-19 admissions into the following types:
> * Nosocomial  
> * **Type C**: *Incidental* cases where there is a primary diagnosis which appears unrelated to SARS-CoV-2
> * **PIMS-TS**: All cases, with sepsis explicitly excluded due to code overlap
> * **Type A1**: SARS-CoV-2 infection is listed as a primary reason for hospital admission
> * **Type A2**: A COVID-19 symptom or typical/plausible presentations of COVID-19 is a primary reason for admission, alongside the presence of other evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection via either a code or test
> * **Type B1**: Acute conditions linked to COVID-19 or that are known to co-occur with COVID-19
> * **Type B2**: Underlying health conditions that are known to make patients sicker with COVID-19 or are conditions that make hospitalisation more likely

❗ Notes on applying the phenotyping algorithm:

* The following typing algorithm is applied **on the above study population**
* This is a *hierarchical* phenotyping algorithm and therefore must be applied in the order listed below ('Typing hierarchy order')
* The population remaining at Step 8 is excluded
