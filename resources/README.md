# Resources

This folder contains a series of Excel spreadsheets used for defining COVID-19 hospital admission types and underlying health conditions (UHCs).  
  
Machine-readable `.csv` files and relevant documentation can be found in the [`/phenotypes/` folder](..\phenotypes\README.md), and parsimonious versions formatted to work with our pipeline can be found in the [`/data/` folder](..\data\README.md).
