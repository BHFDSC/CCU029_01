## Project description

We aim to describe the first occurrences of hospitalisations related to SARS-CoV-2 occurring amongst all first infections in the under-18 population in England. We use a hierarchical approach to categorise admissions according to their nature using input from a board of expert clinicians. These categories identify those admissions caused or contributed to by SARS-CoV-2 infection, versus admissions that were incidental to infection or nosocomial, splitting into interesting and significant sub-types where appropriate. Additionally, we explore the role and changing distributions of demographics, underlying health conditions and risk factors, and variant eras in these admissions.
